FM. BISON synthesizer design
Version 0.1

- 1 patch can be used a time. I might want the parameters to be tweakable (either wrapped in VST or by XML);

- Polyphony is currently 8, but it won't be much of a problem to enlarge that to 16, in which case a basic voice stealing is used.

- A patch is driven by a single carrier and 1 modulator for now; changing this related to more elaborate patches which is not on the agenda just yet.

- 1 global ADSR modulates drives amplitude, 1 global cosine tilt LFO (for now) modulates the carrier frequency. It makes sense to have a few operations on hand to on how these envelopes are applied, but not before the next iteration.

- After a simple dry voice mix the samples are fed to a MOOG ladder filter (which has cutoff and frequency
parameters); another control allows you to mix between wet and dry signal.

- A global gain rotary or fader that amplifies the dry mix; much like drive on most guitar amplifiers.

- Unique feature: 'vorticity'. It is a cheap approximation of vortex shedding which is applied upon release
of a note by combining the Strouhal value with a frequency modulated LFO.
