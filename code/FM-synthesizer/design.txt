For a first release to be ported to VST for alpha testing, I'm picking a very simple design:

- 1 patch at a time with limited but useful polyphony.

- A patch is driven by 1 carrier and 1 modulator, the latter now being a sine wave. The carrier waveform can
be a variety of BLIT and aliasing waveforms.

- 1 global ADSR drives how all notes are played; as with any controls in the synthesizer they will be updated,
or pulled per frame and thus there is a slight but undetectable latency. The ADSR will have non-linear properties
and the length of the attack phase (and likely release) will be scaled according to the note velocity.
  * Add decay, non-linearity and operations (see below).

- The ADSR can influence the patch in a variety of ways; initially this will be default (modulate).
I'll have to think of options that make good sense to add.

- 2 optional LFOs (that either have frequencies below the audible spectrum i.e. 20Hz or are also permitted in the
sonic range) drive the amplitude of a voice and it's FM depth (or 'index' if you will) respectively.
  * Implement.

- After a simple dry mixing phase samples are fed to a MOOG ladder filter (which has cutoff and frequency)
and then, per sample, and interpolation is done between that dry state and filtered as the MOOG filter
makes everything sound like a cheap church organ is snorting Valium.

- A master "volume" rotary or fader that can be seen as a 'drive' on the dry sample mixing.

- Hip feature: vorticity. A cheap approximation of the vortex shedding concept which is applied on release of a note by combining the Strouhal value with a frequency modulated LFO.

This feature set is about 60% complete at time of writing.
