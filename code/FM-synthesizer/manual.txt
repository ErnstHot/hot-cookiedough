FM. BISON by syntherklaas.org :: Dutch street synthesis, a subsidiary of visualizers.nl

Hybrid FM synthesis software/firmware.
Revision: 0.2-0.3

[ Introduction ]

FM. BISON offers relatively low complexity without comprimising itself as a bonafide instrument.
Much like M. BISON (Street Fighter 2, Capcom) it's powreful yet predictable. These goals make
for an instrument that is versatile and powerful but won't give you headaches as so many VST
plugins do; and a lot of hardware synthesizers alike.

During the design phase I used an M-AUDIO Oxygen 49 keyboard and promised to fit the entire
gamut of possibilities on it. Did I succeed? Give or take 1-2 boolean settings: yes.

[ What is it not? ]

Native Instruments FM8, a Yamaha DX7 or any other instrument that offers you, in all fairness,
more flexibility. But at such a price that it seldom saw proper use; run through the DX7 patches
and you've got your yearly dose of 1980s pop music.

[ Design in a nutshell ]

- 24 voice polyphony
- FM synthesis with 2 algorithms & 6 oscillators
- FM modulation, brightness, vibrato
- 4 autonomous wavetable oscillators provide percussion, piano & guitar
- End-stage ladder filter with 3 variations, ran per voice, optionally modulated by ADSR
- Configurable feedback effect
- Intuitive ADSR envelope
- Tremolo
- Pitch bend
- Master drive

[ Third party credits ]

I've used people's knowledge, articles and code extensively, so credit is due:

- Magnus Jonsson: Microtracker MOOG filter
- D'Angelo & Valimaki: improved MOOG filter (paper: "An Improved Virtual Analog Model of the Moog Ladder Filter")
- Transistor ladder filter impl. by Teemu Voipio (KVR forum)
- ADSR implementation by Nigel Redmon of earlevel.com
- juce_LinearSmoothedValues.h taken from the Juce library by ROLI Ltd. (only used for test MIDI driver)

Thanks, a *lot*, for your advice and willingness:

[ How to use ]

- When using a wavetable carrier form, frequence modulation is disabled; all other features function as usual.
  This is because applying FM to arbitrary samples often just results in unusable noise.
