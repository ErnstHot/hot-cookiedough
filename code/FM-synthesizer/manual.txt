FM. BISON by syntherklaas.org :: Dutch street synthesis, a subsidiary of visualizers.nl

Hybrid FM synthesis software/firmware.
Revision: 0.2-0.3

[ Introduction ]

FM. BISON offers relatively low complexity without comprimising itself as a bonafide instrument.
Much like M. BISON (Street Fighter 2, Capcom) it's powreful yet predictable. These goals make
for an instrument that is versatile and powerful but won't give you headaches as so many VST
plugins do; and a lot of hardware synthesizers alike.

During the design phase I used an M-AUDIO Oxygen 49 keyboard and promised to fit the entire
gamut of possibilities on it. Did I succeed? Give or take 1-2 boolean settings: yes.

[ What is it not? ]

Native Instruments FM8, a Yamaha DX7 or any other instrument that offers you, in all fairness,
more flexibility. But at such a price that it seldom saw proper use; run through the DX7 patches
and you've got your yearly dose of 1980s pop music.
