FM. BISON by syntherklaas.org :: Dutch street synthesis, a subsidiary of visualizers.nl

Hybrid FM synthesis software/firmware.
Revision: 0.2-0.3

[ Introduction ]

FM. BISON offers relatively low complexity without comprimising itself as a bonafide instrument.
Much like M. BISON (Street Fighter 2, Capcom) it's powreful yet predictable. These goals make
for an instrument that is versatile and powerful but won't give you headaches as so many VST
plugins do; and a lot of hardware synthesizers alike.

During the design phase I used an M-AUDIO Oxygen 49 keyboard and promised to fit the entire
gamut of possibilities on it. Did I succeed? Give or take 1-2 boolean settings: yes.

[ What is it not? ]

Native Instruments FM8, a Yamaha DX7 or any other instrument that offers you, in all fairness,
more flexibility. But at such a price that it seldom saw proper use; run through the DX7 patches
and you've got your yearly dose of 1980s pop music.

[ Features ]

* 24 voice polyphony; all features are processed per voice unless stated otherwise
* 5 anti-aliased carrier oscillators, 4 wavetable oscillators, and then some (used internally)
* Choice of 3 end stage ladder filters that can be applied uniformly or by note velocity
* FM modulation, brightness & vibrato
* Tremolo
* Pitch bend
* Global feedback effect
* Industry standard ADSR envelope
* 2 basic algorithms

[ How to use ]

- When using wavetable carrier forms, frequence modulation is disabled; all other features function as usual.
  This is because applying FM to arbitrary samples often just results in unusable noise.
  However, the carrier will still be modulated; it functions as a pitch.
