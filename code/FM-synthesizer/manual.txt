FM. BISON by syntherklaas.org :: Dutch street synthesis, a subsidiary of visualizers.nl

Hybrid FM synthesis software/firmware.
Revision: 0.3

[ Introduction ]

FM. BISON offers RISC-style complexity without comprimising itself as a bonafide instrument.
Much like M. BISON (Street Fighter 2, Capcom) it's flashy yet predictable. These goals make
for an instrument that is versatile and powerful but won't give you headaches as so many VST
plugins do and a lot of hardware synthesizers alike.

During the design phase I used an M-AUDIO Oxygen 49 keyboard and promised to fit the entire
gamut of possibilities on it. Did I succeed? Give or take 1-2 boolean settings: yes.

[ What is it not? ]

Native Instruments FM8, a Yamaha DX7 or any other instrument that offers you, in all fairness,
more flexibility. But at such a price that it seldom saw proper use; run through the DX7 patches
and you've got your yearly dose of 1980s pop music.

[ Features ]

* 32 note polyphony (might be a bit less on limited embedded platforms).
* 8 different carrier oscillators, 2 of them dedicated to Roland TR-808 style percussion.
* Fully fledged master ADSR envelope.
* 2 serial LFOs, fully controllable, in charge of frequency modulation.
* 2 different MOOG ladder filters sporting cutoff, resonance, wetness and a wetness envelope tied to your voices.
* Frequency modulation shape & brightness.
* Powerful reverb effect with optional flanger modulation.
* Master (over)drive.
* Controls tailored to allow for a minimum of noise, thereby allowing confident use of all features.
* Written in fairly plain C++, easily portable to embedded platforms.
* Last but not least: free of copyrighted or patented algorithms.

This is it, for now. 
One thousand more features are possible; the art is to know where draw the line.
