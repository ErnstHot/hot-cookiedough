-- new list (2018) --

** possible announcement for the Shader Superfights Heavyweight GP 2019! **

working on now:
- check lutcosf()'s correctness
- why does OpenMP work on x64 and completely fail on x86?
- create texture mapping version of map blitters
- add some tricks to map blitter, like interlacing
- bring new optimization over to bsamp32() (packing instructions)

to do:
- garbage collect images (instead of having to free them manually all the time)
- implement: Heartquake water
- find a way to parametrize relevant values of each effect in a readable way so they can be controlled
  by Rocket
 
low priority / remember:
- app. icon
- configuration dialog
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() has 64 rows per pattern hardcoded momentarily
- 2007 horizontal blur has bias flaw

effects to make:
- create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!), and more of these!
- particles, requested by Nytrik (ask him what he likes best)
- VHS distortion
- true 3D?

for OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

when out of ideas: optimize + FIXMEs
