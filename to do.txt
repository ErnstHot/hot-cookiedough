priority:
- move to SDL 2.0 (also try to replace DevIL)
  + replace WinMain() with main()
  + focus issues w/debugging in (fake) full screen
- OSX/Linux build (SDL and BASSMOD are available, use CMake?)
- fix 64-bit build: 64-bit BASSMOD(?) & SDL
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- review effects
  + blur: fix bias flaw
  + polar: loop can be tighter
  + ball: see top
  + landscape: rewrite, see top

  + twister: rewrite
  + cspan.h: speed (divide)

this would be nice:
- move effect initialization to demo.cpp?
- deprecate shared.cpp?
- implement Heartquake water (rev. engineering notes are on MacBook)
- for the voxel ball, the non-stop Ibiza experience seems to simply add a static environment map
- do something about tedious deletes & error checks (upgrade C++)
- add generic crash handler (see TPB-xxx) & design build (for full speed sync.)
- add application icon

in case you're bored, add:
- free-directional FX with fast interpolation & map mixing
- fancy font writers (also: scroller)
- radial blur
- scaling
- lens, plane distort, et cetera
- 3D
- adlib (or SID?) playback
