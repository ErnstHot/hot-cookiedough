For all things regarding TPB-07, let's go for the immediates:

** Part 1: landscape **

- Render waveform of Apollo communication?
- Shooting star on sync. halfway.

** Part 2: voxel ball **

- Ever so slightly hide that we're using Orange's maps -> WIP.
- Fix background?

** Part 3: credits and plasma **

I'm fine with how this looks, are you guys?
- Add credit for Celin's vocals!

+++ NEEDS OVERLAY GRAPHICS/FX +++ ** Part 4: spikey balls synchronized with dirt backdrop **

Jade is working on this!

** Part 5: Stars/NoooN tunnel & free-directional tunnel **

- Tweak blending for Stars tunnel.
- New but likewise coloured map for free-directional tunnel.

+++ NEEDS ATTENTION BY SUPERPLEK +++ ** Part 6: Nautilus tunnel **

- Dress up in some way.

** Part 7: up-close spikey balls **

- Make it look more interesting: could be overlay(s), could be more interesting effect.

** Part 8: the golden tunnel **

- Simply needs some dressing up.

** Part 9: greetings "Laura" boxy tunnel **

- Render greetings, Jade has an idea.

** Part 10: TPB goes to Mexico logo VS. Nate Diaz "ending" **

- I'm OK with this for now.
