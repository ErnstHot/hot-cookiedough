-- new list (2018) --

possible announcement for the Shader Superfights Heavyweight GP 2019!

to do w/priority:
- implement: simple marched plasma
- garbage collect resources (and eradicate a ton of repetitive shit)
- look if cspan() can be optimized (I think it's very possible)
- look if bsamp*() can be optimized, I think I can do with only a single AND-clamp!
- create sampling functions that don't require a prepare call first?
- implement: Heartquake water

to do:
- add aspect ratio constant
- *parametrize* all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- an easy way to multithread certain effects by tiling or entirely
- generic crash handler
- application icon

remember:
- blur bias flaw (invisible, but it's there)
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- if I want flexible multiple instances of effects I'll at least have to put their parameters in objects

effect ideas:
- #1) create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!), and more of these!
- #2) create a framework (class) that makes it very easy to port and thread Shadertoy/GLSL
- #3) scaling routines
- #4) particles, requested by Nytrik (ask him what he likes best)
- true 3D

OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

when out of ideas: optimize + FIXMEs
