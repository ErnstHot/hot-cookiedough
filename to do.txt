For all things regarding TPB-07, let's go for the immediates:

** Part 1: landscape **

- Enhance landscape rendering?
- Render waveform of Apollo communication?
- DEMO NAME IN SAME STYLE AS CREDITS?

** Part 2: voxel ball **

- Ever so slightly hide that we're using Orange's maps.
- Fix background.
- Any further requests? Feel free.

** Part 3: credits and plasma **

I'm fine with how this looks, are you guys?

+++ NEEDS OVERLAY GRAPHICS/FX +++ ** Part 4: spikey balls synchronized with dirt backdrop **

We need something going on in terms of overlays to make it a bit more interesting.
Another effect here is not off the table either.

+++ NEEDS OVERLAY GRAPHICS/FX +++ ** Part 5: Stars/NoooN tunnel & free-directional tunnel **

- Overlay referencing Stars and the year 1995 on top of the "earthy" voxel tunnel.
- New texture maps (tiling, 512x512 or higher!) for free-directional tunnel.

+++ NEEDS ATTENTION BY SUPERPLEK +++ ** Part 6: Nautilus tunnel **

- Sync. "disco guys" (a Thorsten a.k.a Ernst Hot classic; don't ask, TPB always has them).
  + Maybe just only show them once things 'go orange'?
- Any other ideas? -> Ernst has some, read in Messenger!

** Part 7: up-close spikey balls **

- I really have no idea, perhaps just dress it up a bit with a vignette, overlay and colour tweaks?
- Did most of the above: now render different specular to another target, blur it, and add it on top!

+++ NEEDS OVERLAY GRAPHICS/FX +++ ** Part 8: the golden tunnel **

- Simple overlay and a bit tighter sync. will do the trick?

+++ NEEDS OVERLAY GRAPHICS/FX +++  ** Part 9: greetings "Laura" boxy tunnel **

- Render greetings, Jade has an idea.

** Part 10: TPB goes to Mexico logo **

+ Could use a 'VS/Ft. BYPASS' in there?
