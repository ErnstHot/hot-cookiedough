Facebook goals 06/08:
- 2x2 blitter scanline glitch.
- Radial blur.
- Write second draft of Rocket parameter guide.
- Research glitchy/chromafuck post processing in software (precalculated maps all the way or perhaps rendering to a true retro TV like YUV target first?).
- Cheaper than cheap noise function for software shaders.
- Change fugly fdtunnel test into simple flowery mask effect like in Stars/NoooN.

priority:
- fix map blitting so that it fills the entire screen
- make all shaders look more interesting (turn tunnel into flower from Stars/NoooN!)
- rig more parameters!
- write a Rocket track guide (short explanation, ranges, et cetera)
- figure out a good way to let Nytrik define colors as an asset
- better dithered blit!

to do:
- polar blit for 2x2 map
- app. icon
- configuration dialog (at least audio & VSYNC.)
- take a look at that twister, it's a bit sloppy
- rewrite horizontal blur (see below)
- implement: Heartquake water

possible optimizations:
- functions like Mix32() can handle at least 2 pixels per iteration
- write (faster?) 32-bit cspan() and use with voxel ball
- there's probably more SIMD that can be more efficient using better packing, new instructions et cetera

effects to make & research (per Nytrik's request):
- glitch post-processing: think we're going to have to go with precalculated map distorts, mostly
- text writers (need inspiration)
- create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!)

remember:
- 2007 horizontal blur has bias flaw
- 32-bit build dropped for now (see main.cpp)

for OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

always tend to: optimize + FIXMEs
