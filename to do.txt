- Fix background and perhaps some kind of overlay, something going on?

** Part 3: credits and plasma **

Finished for beta.

** Part 4: spikey balls synchronized with dirt backdrop and Bypass "logo" **

Finished for beta.

Except:
- Blend mode of "text" (see Facebook conversation).

** Part 5: Stars/NoooN tunnel & free-directional tunnel **

Finished for beta.

** Part 6: Nautilus tunnel **

- Finished for beta / Need more lighting around the map edges:?

** Part 7: up-close spikey balls **
