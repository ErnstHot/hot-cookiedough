For all things regarding TPB-07, let's go for the immediates:

** Part 1: landscape **

- I promised a shooting star.

** Part 2: voxel ball **

- Ever so slightly hide that we're using Orange's maps -> WIP.
- Fix background and perhaps some kind of overlay, something going on?

** Part 3: credits and plasma **

Finished for beta.

** Part 4: spikey balls synchronized with dirt backdrop and Bypass "logo" **

Finished for beta.

Except:
- Blend mode of "text" (see Facebook conversation), though it's close enough now, right?

** Part 5: Stars/NoooN tunnel & free-directional tunnel **

Finished for beta.

** Part 6: Nautilus tunnel **

- Rim not implemented to first silhouette: what about adding the rim to the image it should be applied to itself?

** Part 7: up-close spikey balls **

- I am using another (the blue 'film' one) vignette (mostly for it's color grading), looks more like what was intended in the preview render.

** Part 8: the golden tunnel **

- I have scaled the logo up so it sort of 'fills' the left side of the screen more, which I personally feel looks much better.
- Rim not implemented: what about adding the rim to the image it should be applied to itself?

** Part 9: greetings "Laura" boxy tunnel **

Foinished for beta.

** Part 10: TPB goes to Mexico logo & TPB's 2001 - 2023 ending **

Finished for beta.
