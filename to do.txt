-- new list (2018) --

possible announcement for the Shader Superfights Heavyweight GP 2019!

do:
- implement: Heartquake water, Clone meets clone tunnels
- *parametrize* all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- multithreading? (supersampling, render targets)
- garbage collect resources (and eradicate a ton of repetitive shit)
- generic crash handler
- application icon
- when out of ideas: optimize + FIXMEs

remember:
- blur bias flaw (invisible, but it's there)
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- if I want flexible multiple instances of effects I'll at least have to put their parameters in objects

effect ideas:
- raymarched/raytraced stuff (with interpolation or multi-threading)
- scaling routines
- lens distort
- true 3D
- adlib playback

OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?
