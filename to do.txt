-- new list (2018) --

- pick another X64-compatible module player
- upgrade Rocket
- upscale to?
- optimize landscape (eliminate floating point as much as possible)
- implement Heartquake water
- multithreading? (supersampling, render targets)
- there's probably a lot of duplicate voxel code you can stash in a header (voxel-shared.h?)

-- old list (cross off what no longer applies) --

priority:
- move to SDL 2.0 (also try to replace DevIL)
	+ replace WinMain() with main()
	+ focus issues w/debugging in (fake) full screen
- OSX/Linux build (SDL and BASSMOD are available, use CMake?)
- fix 64-bit build: 64-bit BASSMOD(?) & SDL
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- review effects
	+ blur: fix bias flaw
	+ polar: loop can be tighter
	+ ball: see top
	+ landscape: for maps:
	http://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=comanche
	+ twister: rewrite
	+ cspan.h: speed (divide)

this would be nice:
- move effect initialization to demo.cpp?
- deprecate shared.cpp?
- implement Heartquake water (rev. engineering notes are on MacBook)
- for the voxel ball, the non-stop Ibiza experience seems to simply add a static environment map
- add generic crash handler (see TPB-xxx) & design build (for full speed sync.)
- add application icon

in case you're bored, add:
- free-directional FX with fast interpolation & map mixing
- fancy font writers (also: scroller)
- radial blur
- scaling
- lens, plane distort, et cetera
- 3D
- adlib (or SID?) playback
