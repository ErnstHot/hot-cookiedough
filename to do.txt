priority:
- fix map blitting so that it fills the entire screen
- make shaders look more interesting
- rig parameters!
- shaders should use more SIMD earlier on in color calculation

to do:
- implement: Heartquake water
- app. icon
- configuration dialog (at least audio & VSYNC.)
- rewrite horizontal blur (see below)
- take a look at that twister, it's a bit sloppy
- write a Rocket track guide (short explanation, ranges, et cetera)
- figure out a good way to let Nytrik define colors as an asset

possible optimizations:
- functions like Mix32() can handle at least 2 pixels per iteration
- write (faster?) 32-bit cspan() and use with voxel ball
- there's probably more SIMD that can be more efficient using better packing, new instructions et cetera

effect ideas:
- displacing per scanline
- create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!)
- particles, requested by Nytrik (ask him what he likes best)
- trace a high quality radial blur? https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sfGRn

remember:
- 2007 horizontal blur has bias flaw
- 32-bit build dropped for now (see main.cpp)

for OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

always tend to: optimize + FIXMEs
