-- new list (2018) --

do:
- parametrize size of render target
- pick another X64-compatible module player and fix 64-bit build
- upgrade Rocket
- upscale to?
- implement Heartquake water
- multithreading? (supersampling, render targets)
- there's probably more duplicate voxel code you can stash in a header (voxel-shared.h?)
- idea: parametrize all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- there's always room for optimization, this is old stuff

remember:
- blur bias flaw
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- OSX/Linux build (SDL and BASSMOD are available, use CMake?)

-- old list (cross off what no longer applies) --

this would be nice:
- move effect initialization to demo.cpp?
- deprecate shared.cpp?
- implement Heartquake water (rev. engineering notes are on MacBook)
- for the voxel ball, the non-stop Ibiza experience seems to simply add a static environment map
- add generic crash handler (see TPB-xxx) & design build (for full speed sync.)
- add application icon

in case you're bored:
- free-directional FX with fast interpolation & map mixing
- fancy font writers (also: scroller)
- radial blur
- scaling
- lens, plane distort, et cetera
- 3D
- adlib (or SID?) playback
