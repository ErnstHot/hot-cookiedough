priority:
- fix map blitting so that it fills the entire screen
- make Laura & Spikey more interesting
- figure out a neat way to tie parameters to Rocket sync.

to do:
- implement: Heartquake water
- create texture mapping version of map blitter(s)
- garbage collect images (instead of having to free them manually all the time)
- app. icon
- configuration dialog

possible optimizations:
- bring new optimization over to bsamp32() (packing instructions)
- polar blit: write 4 pixels at a time
- functions like Mix32() can handle 2 pixels per iteration!

effect ideas:
- create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!)
- blur specular highlights (as seen in Aura for Laura)
- particles, requested by Nytrik (ask him what he likes best)
- trace a high quality radial blur? https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sfGRn

remember:
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() has 64 rows per pattern hardcoded momentarily
- 2007 horizontal blur has bias flaw (write or steal new blurs)
- 32-bit build dropped for now (see main.cpp)

for OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

always tend to: optimize + FIXMEs
