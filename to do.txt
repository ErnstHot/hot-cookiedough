do:
- bug: tunnel looks weird if render target resolution lower than output res.
- implement: Heartquake water, Clone meets clone tunnels
- *parametrize* all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- pick another X64-compatible module player and fix 64-bit build
- upgrade Rocket
- implement Heartquake water
- multithreading? (supersampling, render targets)
- there's always room for optimization, this is old stuff
- OSX/Linux build
- generic crash handler
- application icon
- garbage collect resources (and eradicate a ton of repetitive shit)

remember:
- blur bias flaw
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- there's probably more duplicate voxel code you can stash in a header (voxel-shared.h?)
- if I want multiple instances of effects I'll have to wrap them in objects

effect ideas:
- raymarched/raytraced stuff (with interpolation or multi-threading)
- scaling routines
- lens distort
- true 3D
- adlib playback
