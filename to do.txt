-- new list (2018) --

do:
- fix module sync.
- implement: Heartquake water, Clone meets clone tunnels
- *parametrize* all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- pick another X64-compatible module player and fix 64-bit build
- upgrade Rocket
- implement Heartquake water
- multithreading? (supersampling, render targets)
- there's always room for optimization, this is old stuff
- garbage collect resources (and eradicate a ton of repetitive shit)
- generic crash handler
- application icon

remember:
- blur bias flaw
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- if I want multiple instances of effects I'll have to wrap them in objects

effect ideas:
- raymarched/raytraced stuff (with interpolation or multi-threading)
- scaling routines
- lens distort
- true 3D
- adlib playback

OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
