-- new list (2018) --

possible announcement for the Shader Superfights Heavyweight GP 2019!

for now:
- fix OpenMP parallel loops (test on x86)
- create map interpolator for speedy 2D and marching effects
  + colors first, finish it with a custom ISSE loop!
  + textured version
  + interlaced looks cool to have as an option!
- if that's done: try Nautilus

to do w/priority:
- garbage collect resources (and eradicate a ton of repetitive shit)
- look if cspan() can be rid of the division in it's setup
- look if bsamp*() can be optimized, I think I can do with only a single AND-clamp!
- create sampling functions that don't require a prepare call first?
- implement: Heartquake water

- verify: does your Std3DMath class inline correctly?
  answer: seems like mostly, though I added some Win32 __forceinline here and there to help it along

to do:
- *parametrize* all relevant values so they can be Rocket-controlled (including map constants et cetera)
- generic crash handler
- application icon
- SDL offers enough tools to create a configuration dialog

remember:
- it's very possible to optimize cspan() to handle 4-pixels-at-once cases, but right now there's no priority
- Audio_Rocket_Sync() now assumes 64 rows in a pattern
- blur bias flaw (invisible, but it's there)

effect ideas:
- #1) create a ripple blitter (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldSSD1 looks nice!), and more of these!
- #2) create a framework (class) that makes it very easy to port and thread Shadertoy/GLSL
- #3) scaling routines
- #4) particles, requested by Nytrik (ask him what he likes best)
- #5) VHS distortion?
- true 3D

OSX/Linux build:
- switch module player
- CMake?

when out of ideas: optimize + FIXMEs
