For all things regarding TPB-07, let's go for the immediates:

** Part 1: landscape **

- I promised a shooting star.

** Part 2: voxel ball **

- Ever so slightly hide that we're using Orange's maps -> WIP.
- Fix background and perhaps some kind of overlay, something going on?

** Part 3: credits and plasma **

I'm fine with how this looks.

** Part 4: spikey balls synchronized with dirt backdrop and Bypass "logo" **

Looks finished to me.

** Part 5: Stars/NoooN tunnel & free-directional tunnel **

FINISHED.

** Part 6: Nautilus tunnel **

- It has been dressed up and synchronized nicely.
- We're waiting to add a silhouette of Jacques Cousteau (Jade!).

** Part 7: up-close spikey balls **

- The effects are tame but nice (or at least I think so), but something needs to happen on top!

** Part 8: the golden tunnel **

- Simply needs some dressing up, not too much, effect does the trick on it's own when paced properly.

** Part 9: greetings "Laura" boxy tunnel **

- Jade's idea is partially implemented, but we do need to make it look nicer, and add that group Comatron asked for.

** Part 10: TPB goes to Mexico logo & TPB's 2001 - 2023 ending **

- I'm OK with this for now, mabye Nytrik can tweak it a bit?
