This is a little testbed I set up to experiment with some retro (demoscene) graphics effects, back in 2007-2009.
It shall henceforth be reffered to as 'cocktails at Kurt Bevacqua's' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Bevacqua).

It's built using Visual Studio 2017.

- 25/07/2018: got it running, back in production.
- Use Ground Control as sync. editor for Win10 (https://github.com/edoreshef/ground-control)

Disclaimer: I've worked this over 10 years in varying states of mental clarity, so I know there's enough low hanging fruit.

** Has content from Comanche (videogame by Novalogic in the early 1990s).  
** Has content from The Non-stop Ibiza Experience (demoscene, Orange).

Said content will not be spread in the form of a release.
