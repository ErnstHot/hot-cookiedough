This is a little testbed I set up to experiment with some retro (demoscene) graphics effects, back in 2007-2009.
Especially the stuff I didn't really grasped as an early teenager: voxels.

It's built using Visual Studio 2017.

- 25/07/2018: got it running, back in production.
- Use Ground Control as sync. editor for Win10 (https://github.com/edoreshef/ground-control)
