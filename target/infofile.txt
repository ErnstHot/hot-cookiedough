a retrosexual multimedia demonstration in co-operation with TPB,
called 'ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT', created for Revision 2023

system req.:
  + semi-recent CPU *with* SSE4 and/or NEON (runs on a MacBook Air M2, but please throw all you have at it!)
  + for Intel go to '/x64' (working directory) and run 'VS17.exe' from that directory -- OSX Silicon/Intel/Linux version will be released soon, please give us a few days!
  + takes 3 to 5 seconds to start, also don't press escape when the music stops!
  + 100% software rendering, no noteworthy GPU required
  + uses default audio device
  + uses max. 500MB RAM and no disk space is allocated during playback
  + native resolution: 1280x720

to quote Arnold: "who's doing it?"
  + comatron (soundtrack) ft. celin (vocals)
  + jade (graphics)
  + nytrik (ideas, graphics, sync.)
  + superplek (programming, design, sync.)
  + and introducing Ernst Hot formerly known as thorsten/purple (TPB royalty, creative support, Linux)

advisory board / additional:
  + alien (small TPB logo)
  + nautilus effect was adapted to C++/SIMD with explicit permission by the late Weyland Yutani (Michiel v/d Berg); rest in peace soldier!
  + sh0ck/disaster area for his patience and help with the OSX Intel build
  + thec (ideas, support, catering, trigger finger training)
  + dascon (networking)
  + raimo (boy wonder, don't ask)

thank you / licensing / copyright bits:
  + free to use (MIT/CC or comparable license) libraries of all kinds (OpenMP, GNU Rocket, SDL2, BASS, SSE2NEON, visualizers.nl/njdewit technologies (my own company), TinyMT)
  + some textures come from previous The Pimp Brigade productions and are entirely ours to use
  + all NASA space travel commmunications samples come from NASA's website and fall under the Creative Commons license
