	system requirements:
		- any desktop GPU will do (software rendering)
		- a *fast* x64 CPU with SSE 4.1
		- Windows 10 (not tested on earlier versions)
		- a working default audio adapter

	we realize the CPU draw is hefty, so if it doesn't run well
	do like you'd do if it concerned your GPU: watch on Youtube!
		
	"who's doing it?"
		- graphics: Nytrik/Cocoon
		- soundtrack: Dascon/Deadliners
		- programming: Superplek/Bypass
		- shading support: Weyland Yutani (Nautilus shader)

	how to enjoy:
		- turn up the volume, dim the lights
		- go to /target/x64, run VS17.exe

	third party libraries used:
		- SDL 2.0 & DevIL
		- GNU Rocket by Kusma & contributors
		- BASS sound system by Ian Luck
		- Std3DMath by http://www.visualizers.nl
		- sse_mathfun.h by Julien Pommier

	Q: why software rendering?
	A: I picked up an old codebase and before I knew it I was having fun with it
