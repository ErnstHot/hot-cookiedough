	system requirements:
		- software rendering: office-grade desktop GPU will do
		- a *fast* x64 CPU (marching & tracing going on)
		- Windows 10 (not tested on earlier versions)
		- a working default audio adapter
		
	"who's doing it?"
		- 2D, maps, textures: Nytrik/Cocoon
		- soundtrack: Dascon/Deadliners
		- shading support: Weyland Yutani & Flopine
		- C/C++, assembler, SSE 4.1: Superplek/Bypass

	how to enjoy:
		- turn up the volume, dim the lights
		- go to /target/x64, run VS17.exe or VS17-windowed.exe

	third party libraries used:
		- SDL 2.0 & DevIL
		- GNU Rocket by Kusma & contributors
		- BASS sound system by Ian Luck

	Q&A time!

	Q: why demand a proper CPU, did you not optimize?
	A: I'll make the Github repository public soon so you can see I did, we're
	   just pulling off some more complicated effects than the standard software fare

	Q: who is the f*ck is Kurt Bevacqua? 
	A: someone who does not like that little fat Italian called Tommy Lasorda
	
	Q: it crashes or flat out never begins!
	A: please report on Pouet.net or find me on Facebook
