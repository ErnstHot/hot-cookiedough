	a retrosexual multimedia demonstration in co-operation with TPB
	created for Revision 2023

	system req.:
	+ either OSX (Silicon) or Win64 (Intel), nav. to '/bin' and run!
	+ software rendering, no GPU required
	+ uses default audio device
	+ does not use significant RAM or disk space
	+ native resolution: 1280x720

	people involved:
	+ superplek
	+ comatron ft. celin (vocals)
	+ jade
	+ and introducing ernst hot

	advisory board / additional:
	+ dascon (networking)
	+ nytrik (ideas, graphics)
	+ alien (small TPB logo)
	+ raimo (boy wonder)

	thank yous / shameful admissions:
	* 2 shaders were ported off of Shadertoy, their authors/links are mentioned in the source code (see 'shadertoy.cpp')
	* we're using a color- and heightmap from the 1992 game Comanche by Novalogic (upscaled using AI, as is the trend these days)
	* hoplite/orange for making PC software rendering demos that kicked ass, that basically is the entire reason this one exists
   * might be a thing or two from earlier TPB productions in here

	nautilus effect was adapted to C++/SIMD with explicit permission by the late Weyland Yutani (Michiel v/d Berg)
	rest in peace soldier!

	how open are we?
